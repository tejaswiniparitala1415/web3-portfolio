        About Me
    </h2>
    <p> As a Master of Science student in Computer Science at Pace University, I'm immersed in deepening my knowledge and skills in web development, data science, and artificial intelligence. My academic journey enhances my ability to mentor and coach aspiring developers as a community volunteer at Code & Coffee. Here, I apply my passion for building scalable and efficient web applications to help them learn and grow.<br>

        In my volunteer role, I guide developers on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, AWS cloud technologies, and agile methodologies. This hands-on experience enables them to create high-quality solutions that drive business growth and enhance user experiences.<br>
        
        Before pursuing my Master's degree, I was an associate software engineer at ADP India. There, I developed data-driven web applications using the MERN stack, achieving a 70% reduction in payroll processing time and a 20% increase in user satisfaction. My initiatives also led to a 30% increase in website traffic and revenue. Furthermore, I pioneered Docker containers, cutting deployment times by 40% and boosting development efficiency by 30%.<br>
        
        Skilled in full-stack development, DevOps practices, and performance optimization techniques, I thrive in collaborating with cross-functional teams to understand requirements, address challenges, and implement effective solutions. Committed to continuous learning, I stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies.<br>
        
        I am actively seeking opportunities to leverage my technical expertise and problem-solving skills to contribute to the development of cutting-edge software solutions. Connect with me to explore how we can innovate together!<br>
